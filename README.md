# Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹ðŸŽ§

I am a software engineer experienced in designing and developing fast and scalable JavaScript applications. I excel in Agile workflow environments, refactoring, test-driven development, MVC architecture, building APIs, and creating/maintaining databases. In my experience working in different teams to develop full stack applications, I've been described as an understanding, productive and fun teammate!

I'm excited to apply my passion for technology as I am actively seeking a new role within a company.
