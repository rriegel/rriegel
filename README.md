# Hi, I'm Ryan üëãüéß

I excel in Agile workflow environments, refactoring, test-driven development, MVC architecture, building APIs, and creating/maintaining databases. In my experience working in different teams to develop full stack applications, I've been described as an understanding, productive and fun teammate!

I am currently seeking a new role to leverage my skills and make an impact within a company!
