# Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹ðŸŽ§

I am a software engineer experienced in designing and developing fast and scalable JavaScript applications. I excel in Agile workflow environments, refactoring, test-driven development, MVC architecture, building APIs, and creating/maintaining databases. In my experience working in different teams to develop full stack applications, I've been described as an understanding, productive and fun teammate!

I'm excited to apply my passion for technology as I am actively seeking a new role within a company.

### ðŸŽ§ Music Production:
In my free time I enjoy learning music theory and making my own music using FL Studio! To bridge my love for coding and music, I have been working with tone.js in my personal projects, which has been really fun to learn!
