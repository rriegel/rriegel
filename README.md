# Hi, I'm Ryan 👋🎧

I am a software engineer experienced in designing and developing fast and scalable JavaScript applications. I excel in Agile workflow environments, refactoring, test-driven development, MVC architecture, building APIs, and creating/maintaining databases. In my experience working in different teams to develop full stack applications, I've been described as an understanding, productive and fun teammate!

I am currently seeking a new role to leverage my skills and make an impact within a company!

## 📁📂 My latest projects

- developing an app to visualize COVID-19 data using React, Node, HTML/CSS and Chart.js
- building the UI of Reactive Audio - a music sequencer app
- practicing leetcode-style data structures and algorithms
- contributing to open source
